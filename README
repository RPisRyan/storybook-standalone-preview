# Storybook Standalone Preview

Derived from https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/examples/standalone-preview

This project demonstrates a preview running in standalone mode using `parcel`.

To run the standalone preview:

```
npm install
npm run storybook
```

This starts a `parcel` dev server on port `1337` and storybook server on `1338`.
